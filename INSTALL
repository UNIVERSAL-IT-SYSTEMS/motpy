= Installation =

== Get the code ==

You could clone the git repo:

# git clone git://github.com/szimszon/motpy.git
# cd motpy

Or get the latest zip from:

https://github.com/szimszon/motpy/zipball/master

Unzip it and change dir to motpy.

== Copying files ==

Copy motpy script to /usr/local/sbin

# cp motpy /usr/local/sbin

Copy the backend module to python dist-package

like in ubuntu 11.10
# cp homedir.py /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/

If you have a debian based system then you probable have a /usr/share/pam-configs/
directory. You could copy the pam-configs-motpy to it like:

# cp pam-configs-motpy /usr/share/pam-configs/motpy

Copy the config file motpy.conf to /etc/security:

# cp motpy.conf /etc/security

You should change the salt= line to something other. But you have to type 16, 24
or 32 character!

Now the system is half installed.

== Set up the user pin and secret ==

Execute the following:

# motpy -i [username]

If you omit the username than the current user's pin and secrec is set up.

== Config the pam ==

If you have pam-auth-update and you copied the pam-configs-motpy already you can
just run

# pam-auth-update

If you config pam manually then you could put in auth section in pam file:

-- cut --
# If motp is sufficient
auth   sufficient      pam_exec.so expose_authtok debug /usr/local/sbin/motpy
-- cut --

or 

-- cut --
# If motp is required
auth   required      pam_exec.so expose_authtok debug /usr/local/sbin/motpy
-- cut --

Now are almost done.

You should test the config before drop the last privileged session :)

Now you are done.

Thanks for makeing motp so easy to implement!

Have a nice day.
