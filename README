= Readme / FAQ =

== What it is? ==

It's a modular Mobile-One Time Password authentication system for linux PAM
systems.

== How is it work? ==

motpy is a skeleton script which do the OTP validating and provides a solution
for user information management.

motpy imports a backend python module to get and store the user informations to
do the OTP validation.

You can easily create the backend you need. Just look at the existing one. 
(There is no documentation yet about the api :( )

You may send me your backend :)

There is one script that makes the validation executed by pam_exec.so and the
some script handles the user data management.

For usage syntax please see INSTALL and use

# motpy -h

The user can modify his/her own pin and secret or offset data. But if there is
already one set then the user have to authenticate agains it first.


== Where are data stored? ==

See the backend's README.

== Are the data stored as plain text? ==

No. The motpy encrypt symmetrically with AES the pins and secrets offsets and
usernames. Look at the source code.
